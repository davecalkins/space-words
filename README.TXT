Educational 2D game intended to help teach "sight words" (words which don't
follow normal rules, you just have to memorize them).  The student is quizzed
on each word by having it spoken and they then have to click the correct word.
A correct answer blows up the alien ship, an incorrect one allows it to
escape.
